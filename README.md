# Compare and Analyze Data on COVID-19 Infections Provided by the [Robert Koch Institute (RKI)](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html)

## Purpose

The RKI publishes data on COVID-19 Infections for Germany via several channels. The purpose of the code in this repository is to aggregate data from the one source 
in a way that is consistent with the data from the other source. 
This provides a better understanding of how key figures such as the 7-day incidence (7-di) are derived from the detailed data on COVID-19 infections that 
is provided by the districts.
